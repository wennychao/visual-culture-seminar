        <h1>Do you suffer from “mobile phone addiction"?</h1>

        <h2>Wenny chao | Dec. 5th. 2023 | Visual Seminar culture</h2>

        <blockquote>“Jobs didn’t just sell a phone; he sold an experience and a promise of innovation, seamlessly weaving together technology and design. His presentation was not only a showcase of a groundbreaking device but also a lesson in simplicity and elegance, demonstrating how powerful a minimalist approach can be in communication and design. This moment serves as a profound inspiration for aspiring designers, highlighting the importance of user-centric design and the impact of effective storytelling.” By Cristina Miquel Garrido

        <p>But do you know that the top executives of social networking sites don’t even use their own products?Because they know that behind the constant swiping of mobile phones is a game that manipulates human weaknesses. These have been brought to my attention that whether the great user-centered design is actually causing your phone addiction.
        </p>

        <blockquote>“iPhone is a game changer at the moment. It is evolutionary and effects how people live from all over the world.  Before having touch screen, phone on market worked based on keyboard and small screen. I remembered the year when apple release their product, my dad got one. And I was so curious about this product and try to figure out how to use them like an explorer.  The interface is so cool and fluent. I was shocked at the moment because we can play fruit ninja with multiple fingers on screen at the same time.” - by Sharon Liang

        <p>Since the advent of smart phones, almost all users have become "addicted" unknowingly. They scroll non-stop as soon as they pick up their phones, which even affects their work, rest, and physical and mental health. Media analysis pointed out that people’s addiction to mobile phone swiping is no accident.
        </p>

        <blockquote>“The article "Invisible Details of Interaction Design" by Rauno Freiberg touched upon an interesting subject of how digital interaction design inherits traits from the humanistic world. One example the article shared that stood out was swiping horizontally to navigate between pages where the characteristics of this action derived from thousands of years of human intuition. All of these small details and actions that interaction designers would process are seemingly taken from natural human instincts that exist way before the digital era.” - by Vicky Chen
        </blockquote>

        <p>It turns out that all this comes from the design of device and APP designers based on "User Experience" and neuropsychology. When your post gets a like or a big heart, It will stimulate your brain to release dopamine, bringing you a feeling of pleasure. And that’s not all. People are now so reliant on their smartphones that the devices are 'becoming our homes', experts warn.
        </p>

        <blockquote>“Last year, I had my phone stolen from me. I was fortunate enough to be able to buy a phone the next day, but the experience of moving through the world with no Google maps or being able to text someone in case I got lost was such a jarring feeling. I think the tech industry is eager to try and create the next revolutionary product- AI, virtual reality, augmented reality. I wonder what will actually stick and truly change the way we exist in this world.” - by Kirsten Geiger
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>“Apple has become more than just a product; it's akin to a belief system that numerous individuals cannot imagine their lives without. As an increasing number of people depend on iPhones for various aspects of their lives, such as business, social interactions, and personal management, there's a genuine concern about how individuals would cope if the internet were suddenly unavailable. The reliance on Apple products for essential aspects of daily living raises the question of human adaptability in the absence of such technology.”- by Emily Hsieh
        </blockquote>

        <p>As early as 2011, Apple founder Steve Jobs admitted frankly in an interview with the New York Times that “his children cannot freely use technology products at home." At that time, Jobs' youngest daughter was only 13 years old, and has never used the iPad launched by Apple.
        </p>

        <p>Now, not only Jobs, but also many employees at the Silicon Valley headquarters of Google, Apple, Yahoo and other major companies are competing to send their children to the Waldorf School of Peninsula, a private school that emphasizes contact with nature, handicraft creation and play, allowing children to stay away from technology products for a while. In fact, 75% of students’ parents at Waldorf school are senior executives in the technology industry.</p>

        <p id="last">Living in the digital age without the Internet will indeed cause inconvenience to study and work, but compared with the worries and criticisms of these "tech rich" who have become rich through technology, perhaps learning how to control technology autonomously, instead of learning how to use technology is a more important lessons that everyone should work on.</p>

            <p>I've always thought interactions should feel "smooth," but I never think about why one interaction feels smooth while another does not. After reading this, this mystery is solved: We feel smooth when something works as our mind expects, either consciously or unconsciously. Since we already know how the physical world works, we'll expect the digital world to react to an action in a similar way. The more we mimic the digital action to the physical experience, the less users need to learn and remember the digital action, thus creating a smooth experience.

            <p>I feel a lot less optimistic than Jaron when it comes to the future of social media, in a sense that it will ever be separate from the entities that wish to manipulate/commodify their users for profit. Maybe if we payed for social media, Google and Meta will be less inclined to engage with these exploitative/shady methods to create capital above all else, but then again, since when has making money stopped a company from wanting more?

Our info and privacy, they actually help these tech firms make lots of money, even if we don't know it. People should get this, and these firms gotta watch themselves and care more about what they do in society.</p>

I agree with him that having a paid content platforms like Netflix or HBO can lead to a more responsible and constructive digital future. The change of the online system can also led to a more healthy and balance digital environment to prevent self-destruction.</p>

            <p>Alexander Galloway ""Protocol"" touched base with the comparison of the Internet and how since it's created by a human, there are humanistic aspects to the world wide web system. Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, saw the system as ""something much larger, a vision encompassing the decentralized, organic growth of ideas, technology, and society"" (Berners-Lee, 1). In a way, there's a sense of integration of human society with technology, specifically the Internet, because even though the Internet is composed as a decentralized network with many hubs and nodes, there are human management systems that are similar to the decentralized network such as the judicial system, airline system, and hightway system as described by Galloway.</p>

            <p>Galloway explains how the internet works as a distributed network, with no central command and resistant towards hierarchy. This sparked my curiosity for Web3- a term that I often hear but have never looked into until now. After reading a brief history of Web1 to 3 on Investopedia, I wondered whether these large conglomerates like Apple, Meta, or Google are in fact acting as an authority. It's difficult to imagine how we'd exist online without these platforms. Although Web3's goal (from my understanding) seems to be decentralization, I can't help but question if this would every truly be achievable. Maybe it would allow for more people to participate but I think there would still be a dominant, influential force.</p>

            <p>"I watched the “AI and the future of design: Generative AI and creative arms race” presented at Config, and the speaker Ovetta Patrice Sampson touched upon what we as designers need the most, reassurance. The highlight for me was her mentioning that “Machines don’t understand, they recognize, they recognize patterns”. AI can’t replace human creativity, drawing breakthroughs or daydreams. She did warn that if we become too reliant on AI to generate our ideas for us, we may lose our ability to think creatively and independently.
            A reminder that AI is a tool that can be used for good or for bad. It is up to us to decide how we want to use AI in the future of design - ideally to amplify our creativity and innovation, not to replace it."</p>

            <p>While listening to the podcast, I realized my limited grasp of human intelligence itself. Confronted with the question "Can intelligence be computable?"—note that I did not specify "human intelligence"—I found myself without answers. What sets human intelligence apart? How is it distinct from other forms of intelligence we encounter in our daily lives? As humans, we often make the assumption that our thoughts and emotions are universal. However, psychology (and possibly philosophy) would strongly challenge these assumptions. We all suffer from a high degree of Eliza Effect when concerning each other, lacking insight into another person's perspective and relying solely on intricate and precise assumptions.</p>

            <p>In a generation where the use of AI is quite common, this text raises some of my concerns related to algorithms and machine learning. I used to be under the impression that a machine could never have racial bias, but after reading this abstract and an essay by Ruha Benjamin titled "Default Discrimination," I realized that machine learning cannot be neutral; it reflects particular perspectives and forms of social organization that enable some people to assert themselves – their assumptions, interests, and desires – over others.</p>

He claims that this would lead to better quality content and a more positive overall experience.

            <p>I watched a Figma Config talk about how transparency and good practices (avoiding dark patterns) had heavy positive impact in a company's performance and results, which touched me for two reasons. First, because I used to work at a startup that had transparency as its main value, and that's strongly shaped the way I work nowadays aswell. Secondly, it is closely related to the Design and Capitalism presentation we made: avoiding dark patterns is in our hands, it is our responsability as ethical designers.</p>

            <p>"It's incredible to think that this presentation was delivered 16 years ago, introducing a revolutionary user interface. The way Jobs seamlessly demonstrated the iPhone's functionalities, from listening to music to making a phone call, was truly captivating. Looking at the interface today, it might appear dated, but given that this presentation took place in 2007, it stands as a groundbreaking moment in the history of technology.

            One more note: It’s funny that Apple went from “Who want to use a Stylus?, nobody want to use a stylus” to the creation of AirPods and Apple Pencil where people never fails to lose one :D"</p>

            <p>As Vogelstein mentions, the iPhone obviously had a major cultural impact on the human race as it changed the way we interact with technology and consume information, with the smartphone now a prevailing part of our daily lives. As a result, the iPhone has contributed greatly to creating and excelling the app industry. It made me think about what the landscape of the UX/Digital Product design field would look like if it were not for the creation of the iPhone and its influence on apps. What would we be designing if apps did not exist? Of course, websites and any product with a digital component but apps feel like such a big part of the industry that it would be interesting to see if they would be replaced by something else. I’m not sure if I have the answer but it’s an interesting alternative reality to think about. </p>

            <p>I was thrilled that How one interface iPhone changed everything about How we see and use smartphones and the whole music, video, and social media Industry. He mentioned intuitive designs that are easily accessible to users, like the Muti touch display and finger messaging. I was surprised it was only six years ago. Now, designers are considering more user-friendly on different screen sizes and using the body as a tool to control the interface, like the hand motion on the Apple Watch and Face ID. So, in that context, I was thinking about how it looks in  AR and VR screens. And how would the application and website change if virtual screens come true? </p>

            <p>What makes people influenced by social media to buy all of these materialistic items seen on the Internet and to the point that there are "deinfluencers" who have to step in to convince you not to buy things? It's interesting to see how there are two sides of this capitalist system where you would think that in a capitalist society, you would be encouraged to buy more things, yet there are people out there trying to convince others on what is worth spending and investing in, especially like a platform like TikTok that started integrating commercialism into their platform that allows user to purchase items based on reviews from TikTok videos. Would the trend of "deinfluencing" affect the commercial state and overconsumerism or will it just encourage people to conduct more research before being influenced by social media influencers?</p>

            <p>"The reading was a great resource to explore the intricacies of interaction design and the various elements that contribute to creating seamless and intuitive user experiences. Interaction design is a complex field that combines elements of art, psychology, and technology to craft interfaces that resonate with users. Out of all the points, the two main points I was really inspired by were: 

            Metaphors in Interaction Design: Metaphors are powerful tools in interaction design. They help users relate to and understand digital interfaces by drawing parallels with familiar real-world concepts. The use of swiping to navigate through pages, akin to turning the pages of a book, is an excellent example of metaphorical design.
                
            Kinetic Physics: Incorporating real-world physics and motion into interface design can enhance the user experience. Retaining momentum when swiping or using gestures that mimic natural movements, like pinching for zooming, makes the interaction feel more intuitive.
                
            These two were the most interesting to me since they try to mimic nature and natural gestures from our day to day real life to make user experience better and use the skills the user already has to make the flow seamless. I am especially interested in biomimicry and this feels like a far off brother of the same concept.

            <p>It is still very uncertain to define the human relationship with Artificial Intelligence and the extent to which they will achieve synergy. What is clear, however, is that every time we feed more data to AI language models (LLMs) to make them better understand human behavior and respond more efficiently, we are attempting to humanize something that cannot be human. In a way, we are losing the aspects that allow us to relate and our individual criteria, all for the simple need to supply a tool whose future implications we may not fully comprehend.</p>

Later in the podcast the narrators also talked about how the tech companies "think they’re transforming the human race." It seems like the tech companies put themselves on a high position over the general population, have a sense of superiority, like a god looked down to the human race. But then the failure of Google Glass became almost like a slap in the face: they were "overconfident in what they could make people do."</p>

            <p>Galloway explains the history of the Internet and how it evolved into a decentralised network to resist a hierarchical structure. I became curious to find out more about the history of the web itself beyond the mechanics of Internet connection. Based on Investopedia’s description, I believe Galloway is referring to the innovations which occurred during Web 1. It’s interesting to see how our current state of ‘Web 2’ is defined by our ability to have personal identities online. However, this is still only possible through sites like Facebook and Instagram, dominating the space. Web 3’s core concepts of decentralisation and openness seem like exciting ideas- but are they just ideas? I wonder if it would ever be possible for users to truly be in control of their data? Or, will conglomerates still maintain that power, whether or not they are the same ones existing today.</p>

One example the article shared that stood out was swiping horizontally to navigate between pages where the characteristics of this action derived from thousands of years of human intuition. All of these small details and actions that interaction designers would process are seemingly taken from natural human instincts that exist way before the digital era. According to the article "Once Again, The Doorknob" by Olia Lialina, the author states that interaction designers should not dive right into prototyping and making buttons but begin with studying philosophy, Marxism, and cybernetics. It makes sense that one should take a step back and look at the broader picture of where these motions and gestures derived from that enables itself to be a part of the function of interaction design.</p>

It’s funny but also fascinating to hear Steve Jobs explain novel features that today we take as the standard- like how we can easily call one another or easily navigate through a website. Telecom companies had to completely transform their business model and move from charging landline services to data packages which allow you to connect to the Internet. Last year, I had my phone stolen from me. I was fortunate enough to be able to buy a phone the next day, but the experience of moving through the world with no Google maps or being able to text someone in case I got lost was such a jarring feeling.
